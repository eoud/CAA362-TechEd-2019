# TechEd-CAA362

## Usage:

Once you have cloned this repository as a local copy, you can run the clone.sh
script from the main repo dir to create copies of the z_caa362_tpl package
like so:

```
sh clone.sh 000 010
```

This would create copies of the package where all occurences of "tpl" are
replaced with numbers 000 through 010.
